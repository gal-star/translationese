translationese's documentation!
===============================

Welcome to the introduction page of the translationsese project.
The project was developed via Natural Language Processing  Labratory.

------------------
The project's goal is distinguishing between articles that were originaly
written in English and articles written in foreign languages and were
translated into English. This is done based on feature and characteristics
found within the articles texts.

1. Weka 3.7     - Classification tool   arff files for each feature.
2. Nltk Library - Text processing and analysis using nltk library.
3. Sphinx       - Used for documentation.
4. Python 2.7   - processing and analysis written code.

We want to thank our guide, Prof. Shuly Wintner.
